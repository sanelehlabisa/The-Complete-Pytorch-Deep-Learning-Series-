PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial: MLP MNIST Classification Summary
Introduction to Classification

This video focuses on classification using an MLP, contrasting it with regression.
Classification involves labeling data points with discrete values, while regression deals with continuous values.
MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
The dataset is commonly used for testing classification algorithms.
Using PyTorch Data Sets

PyTorch provides built-in datasets, including MNIST, which can be easily loaded using torchvision.datasets.
The dataset can be downloaded automatically if specified, and transforms (like converting to tensors) can be applied.
Data Loaders

Data loaders facilitate batch processing, shuffling, and parallel loading of data.
The num_workers parameter allows for multi-threaded data loading to speed up the process.
GPU Utilization

Using a GPU significantly accelerates operations, especially for large datasets and models.
The video explains how to check for GPU availability and how to move models and data to the GPU.
Model Definition

The model consists of linear layers to process the flattened image data (from 28x28 to 784).
Activation functions like ReLU are used to introduce non-linearity.
Forward Pass

The forward pass reshapes input images and processes them through the network layers.
The output layer produces raw scores for each class, which are then converted to probabilities using the softmax function.
Loss Function

The cross-entropy loss function is used for multi-class classification, combining softmax to produce probabilities.
The model outputs logits, which are transformed into probabilities via softmax.
Training and Testing Loops

The training and testing processes are encapsulated in functions for clarity.
The loops handle model training, loss calculation, and accuracy tracking.
Results and Visualization

The model achieves high accuracy (around 98%) on the MNIST dataset.
Loss and accuracy over epochs are plotted for analysis.
Example Code Snippet for Model Definition

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Define the MLP model
class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MLP, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)  # 10 classes for digits 0-9

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, 784)  # Flatten the input
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)  # No softmax here, handled in loss function

# Example of loading MNIST data
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])
train_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=256, shuffle=True)
