Generative Image Diffusion from Scratch! - PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial
Overview
This tutorial covers the concept of generative image diffusion and its implementation in PyTorch.
Key Concepts
Diffusion Process

The diffusion process involves gradually adding noise to an image and then learning to reverse this process to generate new images.
Forward Diffusion Process

The forward process can be represented as:

x_t = sqrt(alpha_t) * x_0 + sqrt(1 - alpha_t) * noise
where  x_t is the noisy image at time step t, x_0 is the original image, and noise is Gaussian noise.

Reverse Diffusion Process

The reverse process aims to denoise the image:

x_0_hat = (x_t - sqrt(1 - alpha_t) * noise) / sqrt(alpha_t)
Loss Function

The loss function typically used is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted image and the original:

loss = nn.MSELoss()(predicted_image, original_image)
Implementation Steps

Define the Diffusion Model:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DiffusionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DiffusionModel, self).__init__()
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 3, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        )

    def forward(self, x_t, t):
        return self.model(x_t)
Training Loop:

model = DiffusionModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for images in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        noise = torch.randn_like(images)
        alpha_t = ...  # Define alpha_t based on your schedule
        x_t = torch.sqrt(alpha_t) * images + torch.sqrt(1 - alpha_t) * noise

        predicted_image = model(x_t, t)
        loss = nn.MSELoss()(predicted_image, images)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
Output Generation

Generate new images by sampling from the model:

with torch.no_grad():
    generated_image = model(initial_noise, t)
Common Challenges

Training Stability: Requires careful tuning of the noise schedule and model architecture.
Image Quality: Balancing the noise levels to achieve high-quality outputs.
Conclusion
The tutorial provides a foundational understanding of generative image diffusion, emphasizing the forward and reverse processes, loss functions, and training mechanisms.
