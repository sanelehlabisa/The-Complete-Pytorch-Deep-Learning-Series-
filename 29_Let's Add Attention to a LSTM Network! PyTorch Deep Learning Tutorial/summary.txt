Let's Add Attention to a LSTM Network! PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial
Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate the attention mechanism into an LSTM network, enhancing its ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during the decoding phase.
Key Concepts
Attention Mechanism

Improves performance by allowing the model to weigh the importance of different encoder outputs when generating each token in the output sequence.
LSTM Architecture

Combines the strengths of LSTMs for sequence processing with the attention mechanism for improved context handling.
Scoring Function

Computes attention scores for each encoder output based on the current decoder hidden state.

score = torch.tanh(W_a @ encoder_output + b_a)
Attention Weights

Softmax is applied to scores to get normalized attention weights:

attention_weights = torch.softmax(score, dim=-1)
Context Vector

The context vector is derived from the weighted sum of encoder outputs:

context_vector = attention_weights @ encoder_outputs
Implementation Steps

Define the Attention Layer:

class Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super(Attention, self).__init__()
        self.W_a = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.b_a = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(hidden_size))

    def forward(self, encoder_outputs, decoder_hidden):
        score = torch.tanh(self.W_a(encoder_outputs) + self.b_a)
        attention_weights = torch.softmax(score, dim=-1)
        context_vector = attention_weights @ encoder_outputs
        return context_vector, attention_weights
Modify the Decoder to Include Attention:

class DecoderWithAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size):
        super(DecoderWithAttention, self).__init__()
        self.attention = Attention(hidden_size)
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim + hidden_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, decoder_input, encoder_outputs, decoder_hidden):
        context_vector, attention_weights = self.attention(encoder_outputs, decoder_hidden)
        decoder_input = self.embedding(decoder_input)
        lstm_input = torch.cat((decoder_input, context_vector.unsqueeze(1)), dim=-1)
        output, (hidden, cell) = self.lstm(lstm_input, (decoder_hidden, cell))
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, hidden, cell
Training Process

Train the modified LSTM network with attention using the same approach as standard sequence-to-sequence models, ensuring to feed the attention-enhanced decoder.
Conclusion
The tutorial effectively integrates the attention mechanism into an LSTM network, demonstrating the process and benefits of enhanced context handling in sequence generation tasks.
