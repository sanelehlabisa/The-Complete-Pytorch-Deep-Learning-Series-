PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial: Basics (Part 2) Summary
Introduction to Neural Networks

Understanding the architecture of neural networks and how they mimic biological networks.
Key Components

Layers: Building blocks of neural networks (e.g., linear layers).
Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity into the model (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).
Important Functions and Classes

nn.Module: Base class for all neural network modules.
nn.Linear(in_features, out_features): Creates a linear layer.
nn.ReLU(): Rectified Linear Unit activation.
nn.Sigmoid(): Sigmoid activation function.
nn.Tanh(): Hyperbolic tangent activation function.
Creating a Model

Define a custom neural network by subclassing nn.Module.
Implement the __init__ and forward methods.
Forward Pass

Pass input data through the model to get predictions.
Loss Function and Optimizer

Loss Function: Measure the difference between predicted and actual values.
nn.MSELoss(): Mean Squared Error for regression tasks.
Optimizer: Update model parameters based on gradients.
torch.optim.SGD(parameters, lr): Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer.
Training Loop

Iterate through the dataset for a number of epochs.
For each epoch:
Perform a forward pass.
Calculate the loss.
Perform a backward pass to compute gradients.
Update parameters using the optimizer.
Logging and Visualization

Track loss over epochs for visualization.
Use Matplotlib for plotting loss curves and predictions vs. ground truth.
Example Code Snippets
Model Definition:

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = nn.ReLU()(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x
Training Loop:

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_function(outputs, targets)
    
    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
