Semantic Clustering of Text using Pre-trained Hugging Face Models
Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to perform semantic clustering of textual data using pre-trained models from the Hugging Face library, enabling the grouping of similar texts based on their meanings.
Key Concepts
Semantic Clustering

Semantic clustering involves grouping texts based on their semantic content rather than just syntactic similarity, allowing for more meaningful categorization.
Using Hugging Face Models

Pre-trained models from Hugging Face, such as BERT or DistilBERT, are utilized to convert text into dense vector representations (embeddings).
Embedding Generation

The tutorial shows how to generate embeddings for the text data using a Hugging Face model:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")

inputs = tokenizer(texts, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
embeddings = model(**inputs).last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)
Clustering Algorithm

After generating embeddings, a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) is applied to group similar texts:

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
kmeans.fit(embeddings.detach().numpy())
Visualization

Techniques for visualizing the clusters, such as t-SNE or PCA, are discussed to help understand the relationships between clusters.
Performance Considerations

Discusses the importance of selecting the right number of clusters and the impact of different pre-trained models on clustering results.
Conclusion
The tutorial effectively illustrates how to use pre-trained Hugging Face models for semantic clustering of text, providing insights into the process of embedding generation, clustering, and visualization.
