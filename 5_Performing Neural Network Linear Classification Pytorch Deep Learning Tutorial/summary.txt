PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial: Basics (Part 4) Summary
Introduction to Model Evaluation and Testing

Importance of evaluating model performance on unseen data to assess generalization.
Validation vs. Testing

Validation Set: Used for tuning model parameters and selecting the best model.
Test Set: Used for final evaluation of the model's performance.
Key Metrics for Evaluation

Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified instances.
Precision: Ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
Recall: Ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Model Saving and Loading

Use torch.save() to save model weights and architecture.
Use torch.load() to load saved models for inference or further training.
Important Functions and Classes

torch.save(model.state_dict(), filepath): Saves the model's state.
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(filepath)): Loads the model's state.
model.eval(): Sets the model to evaluation mode, disabling dropout and batch normalization.
model.train(): Sets the model back to training mode.
Example Code Snippets

Model Evaluation:

model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode
with torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient calculation
    predictions = model(test_data)
    # Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall
Saving and Loading a Model:

# Save model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')

# Load model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode after loading
Conclusion

Emphasize the importance of model evaluation and the correct use of validation and test datasets to ensure robust model performance.
