Diffusion with Transformers AND Diffusion In-Painting from Scratch!: PyTorch Deep Tutorial
Overview
This tutorial covers the implementation of diffusion models using Transformers, including techniques for in-painting images from scratch using PyTorch.
Key Concepts
Diffusion Models Overview

Diffusion models generate images by gradually transforming noise into coherent images through a learned reverse diffusion process.
Transformers in Diffusion

The tutorial explores how Transformers can enhance the diffusion process by leveraging their ability to capture long-range dependencies in data.
In-Painting Technique

In-painting refers to filling in missing or corrupted parts of an image. The model learns to predict these missing areas by conditioning on the available context.
Model Architecture

A Transformer-based architecture is employed to model the diffusion process, allowing for effective handling of spatial information:

class DiffusionTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super(DiffusionTransformer, self).__init__()
        # Define Transformer layers

    def forward(self, x):
        # Forward pass through the Transformer
        return x
Training Process

The model is trained using a combination of reconstruction loss and diffusion loss to optimize image generation and in-painting capabilities:

criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
Generating and In-Painting Images

The tutorial demonstrates how to generate new images and perform in-painting by conditioning the model on partially observed images.
Performance Considerations

Discusses strategies for optimizing the model and improving image quality, including hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation techniques.
Conclusion
The tutorial provides a detailed approach to implementing diffusion models with Transformers and in-painting techniques from scratch, showcasing the potential of these models for advanced image generation tasks.
