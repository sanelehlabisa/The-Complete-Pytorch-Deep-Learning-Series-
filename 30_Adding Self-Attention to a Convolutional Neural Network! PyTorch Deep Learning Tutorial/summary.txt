Adding Self-Attention to a Convolutional Neural Network! PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial
Overview
This tutorial explores the integration of self-attention mechanisms into convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enhancing their ability to capture long-range dependencies in data.
Key Concepts
Self-Attention Mechanism

Allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input feature map, enabling it to focus on relevant features regardless of their spatial distance.
Benefits of Self-Attention in CNNs

Improves feature representation by allowing the network to consider the global context of the input data.
Attention Scores

Compute attention scores for each pixel in the feature map based on its relationship with all other pixels.

scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / sqrt(d_k)
Softmax Normalization

Apply softmax to the attention scores to obtain attention weights:

attention_weights = torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
Context Vector

The context vector is computed as a weighted sum of the values using the attention weights:

context = torch.matmul(attention_weights, V)
Implementation Steps

Define the Self-Attention Layer:

class SelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels):
        super(SelfAttention, self).__init__()
        self.query = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, in_channels, kernel_size=1)
        self.key = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, in_channels, kernel_size=1)
        self.value = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, in_channels, kernel_size=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        Q = self.query(x)
        K = self.key(x)
        V = self.value(x)
        scores = torch.matmul(Q.view(Q.size(0), Q.size(1), -1),
                              K.view(K.size(0), K.size(1), -1).transpose(-1, -2)) / sqrt(Q.size(1))
        attention_weights = torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
        context = torch.matmul(attention_weights, V.view(V.size(0), V.size(1), -1))
        return context.view_as(x)
Integrate Self-Attention into a CNN:

class CNNWithSelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(CNNWithSelfAttention, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.attention = SelfAttention(64)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(128 * 32 * 32, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = self.attention(x)
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x
Training Process

Train the CNN with self-attention using standard loss functions and optimizers, monitoring performance improvements.
Conclusion
The tutorial successfully demonstrates how to add self-attention to a convolutional neural network, improving feature representation and enabling the model to capture complex dependencies in the input data.
