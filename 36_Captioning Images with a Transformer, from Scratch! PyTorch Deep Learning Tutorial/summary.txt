Captioning Images with a Transformer, from Scratch!: PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial
Overview
This tutorial guides you through the implementation of an image captioning model using a Transformer architecture, allowing for the generation of descriptive captions for images.
Key Concepts
Image Captioning Task

The goal is to generate textual descriptions for images using neural networks, combining computer vision and natural language processing.
Model Architecture

The architecture typically consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction followed by a Transformer model for generating captions.
Feature Extraction with CNN

A pre-trained CNN (like ResNet) is used to extract features from images:

features = cnn_model(image)
Transformer for Caption Generation

The Transformer model processes the extracted features and generates captions using self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms.
Training Process

The model is trained using pairs of images and their corresponding captions, employing a loss function such as cross-entropy:

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
Data Preparation

The dataset must be preprocessed, including tokenizing captions and creating input-output pairs for training.
Inference

During inference, the model generates captions by predicting the next word based on previously generated words and the image features.
Conclusion
The tutorial effectively demonstrates how to build an image captioning system from scratch using a Transformer model, emphasizing the integration of CNNs for feature extraction and Transformers for sequence generation.
