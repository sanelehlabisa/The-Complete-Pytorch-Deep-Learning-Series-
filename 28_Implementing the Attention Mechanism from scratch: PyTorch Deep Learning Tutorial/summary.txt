Implementing the Attention Mechanism from Scratch: PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial
Overview
This tutorial explains how to implement the attention mechanism, which enhances sequence-to-sequence models by allowing the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence during decoding.
Key Concepts
Attention Mechanism

Allows the decoder to weigh the importance of different input tokens when generating output tokens.
Types of Attention

Global Attention: Considers all encoder outputs.
Local Attention: Focuses on a subset of encoder outputs.
Scoring Function

Computes a score for each encoder hidden state to determine its relevance to the current decoder input.
Copy
score = torch.tanh(W_a @ encoder_output + b_a)
Attention Weights

Softmax is applied to the scores to obtain attention weights:

attention_weights = torch.softmax(score, dim=-1)
Context Vector

The context vector is computed as the weighted sum of the encoder outputs:

context_vector = attention_weights @ encoder_outputs
Implementation Steps

Define the Attention Layer:

class Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super(Attention, self).__init__()
        self.W_a = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.b_a = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(hidden_size))

    def forward(self, encoder_outputs, decoder_hidden):
        score = torch.tanh(self.W_a(encoder_outputs) + self.b_a)
        attention_weights = torch.softmax(score, dim=-1)
        context_vector = attention_weights @ encoder_outputs
        return context_vector, attention_weights
Integrate Attention in the Decoder:

class DecoderWithAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size):
        super(DecoderWithAttention, self).__init__()
        self.attention = Attention(hidden_size)
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim + hidden_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, decoder_input, encoder_outputs, decoder_hidden):
        context_vector, attention_weights = self.attention(encoder_outputs, decoder_hidden)
        decoder_input = self.embedding(decoder_input)
        lstm_input = torch.cat((decoder_input, context_vector.unsqueeze(1)), dim=-1)
        output, (hidden, cell) = self.lstm(lstm_input, (decoder_hidden, cell))
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, hidden, cell
