Building a Text Generator With LSTM, From Scratch! - PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial
Overview
This tutorial focuses on creating a text generation model using LSTM networks in PyTorch.
Key Concepts
Text Generation

The goal is to generate coherent text based on a given input sequence.
Data Preparation

Text data is tokenized and converted into sequences of integers. Padding may be applied for uniformity.
LSTM Model Architecture

An LSTM processes the input sequences to learn patterns and generate text.
Loss Function

Cross-Entropy Loss is used for training:

loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(output, target)
Implementation Steps

Define the LSTM Model:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TextGeneratorLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size):
        super(TextGeneratorLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out)
        return out
Training Loop:

Copy
model = TextGeneratorLSTM(vocab_size=10000, embedding_dim=100, hidden_size=64)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for sequences, targets in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(sequences)
        loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(output.view(-1, vocab_size), targets.view(-1))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
Generating Text:

Use the trained model to predict the next word based on a seed sequence.
Common Challenges

Diversity of Output: Implement techniques like temperature sampling for varied text generation.
Conclusion
The tutorial provides a step-by-step approach to building a text generator using LSTMs in PyTorch, covering data preparation, model training, and text generation.
