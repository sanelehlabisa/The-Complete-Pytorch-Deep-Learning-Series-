Classify Images with a Vision Transformer (ViT): PyTorch Deep Learning Tutorial
Overview
This tutorial covers the implementation of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification tasks using PyTorch.
Key Concepts
Vision Transformer Architecture

The ViT model treats images as sequences of patches, applying the Transformer architecture to image data.
Patch Embedding

Images are divided into fixed-size patches, which are then flattened and linearly embedded into vectors:

patches = x.unfold(2, patch_size, patch_size).unfold(3, patch_size, patch_size)
patches = patches.contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, patch_size * patch_size * channels)
Positional Encoding

Adds positional information to the patch embeddings to retain spatial relationships:

pos_enc = self.positional_encoding(torch.arange(num_patches).unsqueeze(0).repeat(batch_size, 1))
Model Implementation Steps

Define the Vision Transformer Model:

class VisionTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes, d_model, n_heads, num_layers):
        super(VisionTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.patch_embedding = nn.Linear(patch_size * patch_size * channels, d_model)
        self.transformer = nn.Transformer(d_model, n_heads, num_layers)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(d_model, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.patch_embedding(x)
        x = self.transformer(x)
        return self.fc(x.mean(dim=1))  # Global average pooling
Training Process

Use cross-entropy loss and an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to train the model for image classification:

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
Conclusion
The tutorial effectively demonstrates how to implement a Vision Transformer for image classification, emphasizing the importance of patch embedding and positional encoding.
